# Petronas Inter-University CTF 2023 Writeup

Welcome to my repository of writeups for the Petronas Inter-University CTF 2023! Here, you'll find solutions to a variety of challenges across different categories, including Cryptography, Memory Forensics, Binary Exploitation, Miscellaneous, Network Forensics, Operational Technology, OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), Reverse Engineering, Steganography, and Wireless Networking.

Please note that this repository does not include all the challenges from the competition, but a sub-set of those that I have downloaded or solved. It contains a subset of the challenges that were available to download. Some challenges, such as web challenges that provided external weblinks, are not included as they may no longer be accessible.
