Fake WinRAR exploit PoC drops VenomRAT malware ; Security researchers and hackers are both in the crosshairs of an unusual lure: malware-laced code touted as proof-of-concept (PoC) script for new, high-profile vulnerabilities. An unknown threat actor moved quickly last month to commit a fake PoC to their GitHub repository, claiming it was an exploit for a new WinRAR vulnerability made public four days earlier. As well as being of interest to researchers, such a PoC would be gold for other cybercriminals given its potential to exploit the very popular Windows data compression, encryption, and archiving tool.  WinRAR is said to have over 500 million users. But according to researchers at Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42, downloading the fake PoC files from GitHub set off an infection chain that eventually installed a VenomRAT remote access trojan payload on the curious party’s machine. 
Cisco to buy cybersecurity firm Splunk for $28 billion ; Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) on Thursday agreed to buy cybersecurity firm Splunk (SPLK.O) for about $28 billion in its biggest-ever deal to strengthen its software business and capitalize on the boom in artificial intelligence. The deal, which is the biggest technology transaction of the year, will help reduce Cisco's reliance on its massive networking equipment business, which has suffered in recent years from supply chain issues and a post-pandemic slowdown in demand. Splunk is known for its strengths in the area of data observability, which helps companies monitor their systems for cybersecurity risks and other threats.  The company operates a subscription-based pricing model for customers. The two companies have held merger talks in the past, but those discussions fell apart, Reuters has previously reported. Cisco offered $157 in cash for each share of Splunk, representing a 31% premium to the company's last closing price.
